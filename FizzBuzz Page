## FizzBuzz Project 
This semester in Intro to Information Technology we had to do a common project called *FizzBuzz*. The purpose of the project is to create a program that will assign a value to a number based on what digits are included. If you would like to learn more about the FizzBuzz project [click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)

**Here's my FizzBuzz Project:**

>for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++) 
{
    if (((i % 5) == 0) && ((i % 7) == 0)) 
        System.out.println("fizzbuzz");
    else if ((i % 5) == 0) 
        System.out.println("fizz");
    else if ((i % 7) == 0) 
        System.out.println("buzz");
    else
        System.out.println(i); 
}

This was a **very** challenging project for me to complete considering I'm brand new to coding. Whether it is 100% correct or not I'm not sure, but I'm still proud of my work.
