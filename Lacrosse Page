## Lacrosse
<p>I played lacrosse for 6 years through middle school and high school. I started in the winter of seventh grade with my friend Judge. I played lacrosse because I had played football for a couple of years and was getting hurt too much. I was always a small kid and that was the reason I needed less contact. Lacrosse was a great compromise because it had the physical aspect I was looking for, but it had less contact than football and would lead to me being injured less. When we got to high school we realized how different it was from the less competetive league for younger kids. Thankfully I had a great coach my freshman year. He incited a drive to get better within all of his players, and if he had not coached me my first year in high school I'm not sure I ever would have achieved the status of starter on the varsity squad. Unfortunately he had to leave the team the next year for personal reasons. Over the next 3 years we had a different coach every year. None were ever as effective as my first coach and the program was on a steady downtrend ever since he left. Even though we were a losing team for the next three years, I still made a lot of friends and enjoyed the sense of comradery that came with playing on the team. It was one of the best parts of my life so far and I would'nt change it for anything.</p>
