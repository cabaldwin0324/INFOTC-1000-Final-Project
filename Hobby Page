## Hobbies:
* Fantasy football
* Watching football
* Playing video games


##### Fantasy Football
Every year I play fantasy football with a group of my friends. It makes watching football more interesting because when you play fantasy football you have more diverse interests in how each team does. I also enjoy that analytical aspect of collecting data on players to project which players will go up or down in value. Here's a link to the fantasy football platform I use.

##### Watching football
I've been watching football for about 13 years now. It's a great way for me to decompress after a long week. I mean, who doesn't like watching some of the greatest athletes in the world do what they're best at? My favorite team is the [Philadelphia Eagles][1] because I really enjoyed watching Desean Jackson and Donovan McNabb play.  


##### Playing video games
Playing video games is a great way for me to connect with my friends when we are not able to see each other in person, which has been more important than ever this year considering the issues with COVID. Along with watching football, it serves as a great way to relax and disconnect from the more stressful parts of life.
