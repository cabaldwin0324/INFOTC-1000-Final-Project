## Friends 
I'm grateful to have some truly good friends surrounding me. I've known all of my friends for more than 8 years so we are a pretty tight group. 

#### Ben
Ben is my oldest friend. We met in elementary school while attending a before and after school program called Kids Country. It was basically a service to watch your child before and after school to give parents enough time to get back and forth from work without their child's school hours affecting it. Over the years we've grown to become great friends who can rely on each other for anything. 

#### Corey
Corey is another friend that I've known since first grade. We were similar as children and enjoyed a lot of the same things so we became friends early. One of my fondest memories of us as children is when I had a rolling backpack in third grade. Every day when school got out we would walk to the area of the school where car riders are picked up by their parents, and the whole way there Corey would want to roll my backpack down the hall because he thought it was fun. 

#### Judge
I met Judge in the seventh grade through Ben. That year I had started playing lacrosse and Ben introduced me to one of his new friends that also started playing lacrosse that year. Judge and I could not have gotten off on a better foot. He was instantly one of my best friends because of our shared interests, along with our unique sense of humor.
